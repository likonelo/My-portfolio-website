            <h2>About Me</h2>
              <p>From a young age, I always had a thirst for education.
             I was greatly influenced by my teachers and the voices of Radio Lesotho presenters. 
             I remember how, during my childhood, my grandmother would play Radio Lesotho since morning till late at night, 
            and that’s where my desire to learn grew stronger.</p>
            <p>After high school, I pursued a Mass Communication course at the Institution of Extra Mural Studies (IEMS).  
            But life had other plans, and soon after, I found myself at the National University of Lesotho campus, 
            studying Library and Information Studies (LIS), a field I never knew existed 
            but I now see how it’s been a path that God made possible for me and it has truly shaped my journey.</p>
            <p>One of the most interesting parts of my LIS course has been the Web design modules. Initially,  
            I didn’t think it was relevant to LIS, I thought “We are not here to study computer science!”
            But I soon realized that libraries are developing, and web design has become an essential skill 
            in the 21st century.
            Thanks to these web design modules, I have learned HTML and CSS and can now create my own websites.</p>
            <p>During my 3rd year, I had the incredible opportunity to do a 2-month attachment at
            Roma College of Nursing although those 2 months I spent there felt too short because I felt like 
           I didn’t have enough time to fully apply all the skills I had learned and was eager to do more. 
           However, this hands-on experience allowed me to put my web design skills to the test. 
           I worked on managing new books entries into the system and creating and generating cards 
            on the system for the book recording process.</p>
            <p>I also completed various web design assignments that allowed me to sharpen
             my skills and showcase my abilities. Each project helped me grow as a web designer
             and I proudly submitted my work to my lecturer for evaluation.</p>

                <h3>Roma College of Nursing | 2024</h3>
                <p>In 2024, I was attached at Roma College of Nursing Library.
                During that two-month attachment, I applied practical web and library skills
               to improve efficiency and user experience. My responsibilities included the following tasks:</p>
                <ul>
                <li>Recording books into the library system</li>
                <li>Cataloguing books for easy retrieval</li>
                <li>Creating detailed book cards for each entry</li>
                <li>Assisting in the management of library resources</li>
                <li>Implementing best practices for library organization</li>

                <h3>High School Library Support | 2023</h3>
                <p>As a member of the Lesotho Library Association, I joined others in visiting St Agnes, Sechaba
              and Kolonyama high school libraries and I assisted with the following activities:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Organized and classified library collections</li>
                    <li>Delivered practical training on cataloguing methods</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>Case Study: State Library of Lesotho | 2025</h3>
                <p>In order to examine whether the State Library of Lesotho meets the needs of people with disabilities,
                 I conducted a case study focusing on three special groups:</p>
                <ul>
           <li>the visually impaired</li>
            <li>individuals with mobility impairments</li>
             <li>those with hearing impairments</li>
             </ul>
            <p> During my study, I discovered that the State Library, with support from Vodacom Lesotho, 
              had made significant improvements in the section serving visually impaired users. 
                 <p> Vodacom provided computers and other assistive equipment to enhance accessibility.</p> 
            <p>Below is an example of a machine that helps visually impaired individuals read printed documents.</p>
